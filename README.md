# Creating-and-Accessing-a-Cloud-hosted-Linux-Virtual-Machine-on-Microsoft-Azure

In this article, I walk through the steps to create and access a cloud-hosted virtual machine on Microsoft Azure. In today's digital age, hosting a website or application on the cloud has become a necessity. Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, provides an easy and efficient way to set up a virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. This article covers the following points.
1. Create a VM instance 
2. Configure SSH keys for secure access to the VM 
3. Access the VM using SSH 
4. Add custom firewall rules in the subnet's security list 
5. Access the VM using RDP from your PC 
6. Host files using a simple HTTP server and access them using the public IP
